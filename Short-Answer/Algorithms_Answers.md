Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
a)O(n) because the while loop is n and the variable assinments are constant
b)O(n^3) because sum = 0 is constant the first 3 loops are based on n and the last for loop is based off a variable created from the previous for loop
c)O(1) because its just checking the input against a constant variable


exercise II)
I would create an algorithm that first creates a variable x that figures out what floor of the n building the person is standing on and then compare x to f. if x greater than or equal x.

If i knew what floor the person was on then i wouldnt need any loops and the variables would be constant so the runtime would be O(1) but if i needed to loop through n to figure out the floor im standing on then t cold be O(n).
